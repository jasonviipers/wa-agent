## Quick Navigation

### For Different Use Cases

**I want to understand the big picture:**
→ Start with [ARCHITECTURE_SUMMARY.md](./ARCHITECTURE_SUMMARY.md)

**I need to implement a feature:**
→ Start with [QUICK_REFERENCE.md](./QUICK_REFERENCE.md) for code examples, then [ARCHITECTURE_SUMMARY.md](./ARCHITECTURE_SUMMARY.md) for the phase it belongs to

**I need detailed technical information:**
→ Use [MARKETPLACE_INTEGRATION_OVERVIEW.md](./MARKETPLACE_INTEGRATION_OVERVIEW.md)

**I need to debug or understand existing code:**
→ Check the File Reference Guide in [MARKETPLACE_INTEGRATION_OVERVIEW.md](./MARKETPLACE_INTEGRATION_OVERVIEW.md) Section 11

### 2. Check What's Ready
Review the Quick Reference in [QUICK_REFERENCE.md](./QUICK_REFERENCE.md) to see what services are ready to use.

### 3. Plan Your Phase
Look at [ARCHITECTURE_SUMMARY.md](./ARCHITECTURE_SUMMARY.md) "Critical Implementation Sequence" to see which phase you're working on.

### 4. Find Code Examples
Search [QUICK_REFERENCE.md](./QUICK_REFERENCE.md) for "Common Integration Workflows" to see complete code examples.

### 5. Get Implementation Details
Use [MARKETPLACE_INTEGRATION_OVERVIEW.md](./MARKETPLACE_INTEGRATION_OVERVIEW.md) sections 5-6 for implementation details on webhooks and sync.

## Important Notes

1. **Database Migrations**: All schemas are defined but may need to be run through Drizzle migrations. Commands: `db:push`, `db:migrate`

2. **Environment Variables**: You'll need credentials for:
   - Shopify: App ID, App Secret, OAuth setup
   - WhatsApp: App ID, App Secret, Phone Number ID
   - Facebook: App ID, App Secret, Page ID, Catalog ID

3. **Webhook URLs**: Must be publicly accessible HTTPS endpoints

4. **Rate Limits**: Each platform has different rate limits:
   - Shopify: ~2 API calls/second
   - WhatsApp: 80 API calls/second  
   - Facebook: varies by endpoint

5. **Cursor Pagination**: All services support cursor-based pagination for large datasets
